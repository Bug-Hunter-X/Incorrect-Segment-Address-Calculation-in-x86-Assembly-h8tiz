```assembly
mov ax, 1000h ; Load a segment address into AX
add ax, 100h  ; Attempt to add a value to it
```
This code snippet is problematic in assembly because it directly adds to a segment address, which is not how memory addressing works. Segment addresses are 16-bit values, but the addition result could exceed this range causing incorrect address calculations.  Also, without further context such as the use of segment registers (CS, DS, ES, etc.), this code leads to undefined behavior, potentially causing a general protection fault.
